# Quick Start

Two ways to develop locally:

| Path | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Docker Compose** (below) | Full stack with one command — API, dashboard, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis |
| **Repos on host** ([§7](#7-run-without-docker-alternative)) | Backend or dashboard changes with hot reload |

Compose lives in **`auth-engine-infra/compose/`**.

!!! abstract "Compose steps"
    **1** Configure `.env` → **2** `docker compose up -d` → **3** Migrate → **4** Seed → **5** Smoke test

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Docker + Docker Compose | Required |
| OpenSSL | Optional — `openssl rand -hex 32` for secrets |

---

## 2. Configure environment

```bash
cd auth-engine-infra/compose
cp env.local.example .env
```

Set `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to unique 32+ character values (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Defaults in `env.local.example` are for local use only.

The compose `.env` holds **credentials and app settings** — database URLs are assembled by `docker-compose.yml` for the API container. Dashboard `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are also set here.

---

## 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| API | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) |
| Swagger | [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) |
| Frontend | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |

Images are pulled from Docker Hub (`qniranjan01/authengine`, `qniranjan01/authengine-dashboard`) as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 4. Run migrations & seed data

```bash
docker exec authengine-api auth-engine migrate
```

RBAC roles, the super admin, and optional platform-tenant config (email, SMS, social OAuth, password policy) are **not** seeded on API startup. Seeding lives in the separate [`auth-engine-data`](https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine-data) repo. After migrations, run it once against the same database:

```bash
cd auth-engine-data
cp .env.example .env.local   # POSTGRES_URL, SECRET_KEY (match API), SUPERADMIN_*
uv sync
uv run auth-engine-data all
```

`auth-engine-data` uses its own `.env.local` (independent from `auth-engine/.env.local`). Optional `EMAIL_*`, `SMS_*`, and OAuth vars for the platform tenant are documented in `auth-engine-data/.env.example`.

---

## 5. Smoke test

1. Call `GET /api/v1/health` in Swagger.
2. Confirm auth config: `GET /api/v1/auth/auth-config` — returns `tenant_id` and `allowed_methods` (no `tenant_id` query needed for platform login).
3. Log in at [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) with super admin credentials (`SUPERADMIN_*` from compose `.env` or `auth-engine-data/.env.local`).
4. Platform routes (`/platform/*`) need a platform-scoped role; tenant routes need a tenant selected in the dashboard.

---

## 6. OAuth providers (optional)

Platform social login (Google, AuthEngine OIDC) is configured on the **platform tenant** — seed once with `auth-engine-data platform-config` (see `auth-engine-data/.env.example`) or set providers in the dashboard. Per-tenant OAuth is managed in the dashboard under tenant settings.

---

## 7. Run without Docker (alternative)

**Backend** — cloned `auth-engine` repo (Postgres, MongoDB, Redis running — use Compose DBs or install locally):

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env.local
auth-engine migrate
auth-engine run
```

**Dashboard** — `auth-engine-dashboard`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci && npm run dev
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` can stay empty — the login page calls `GET /auth/auth-config` and uses the returned `tenant_id`.
